Bolt URL: https://wikipedia-search-app-tsuu.bolt.host
GitHub repo URL: https://github.com/PotatoLatte/cs1060-PotatoLatte-hw1
Netlify Deployment URL: https://68be5c7edb0fe9eea9c075e1--precious-kleicha-aba05c.netlify.app/

I worked on the entire thing, and it took me 1 hour, mostly to figure out how to set up the GitHub respository and Netlify Deployment. While creating the app, at first Bolt had some UI issues with the locations of items on the screen, so I had it fix it so that it was easier to read/use.
